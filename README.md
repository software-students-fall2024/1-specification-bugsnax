## Stakeholders

**Name: Melissa Shin**

About my Stakeholder: My stakeholder works for a fashion retail brand. With a career in fashion and a deep-rooted interest in clothing, she is deeply invested in the clothing space, and can consequently have too many clothes in one sitting.

Goals, needs, & Desires:
- I want to be able to track what I wear daily
- I want to easily categorize and visualize my clothes
- Reduce closet clutter: remove clothes that I don't wear/that I have in excess
- Coordinate and plan outfits seamlessly

Problems & Frustrations:
- Closet clutter: too much clothes in closet
- Frustrated with repeatedly wearing the same outfits despite having more clothes
- Hard to keep track of seasonal clothing that is out of closet/in storage
- I don't like when I buy clothing, just to hardly ever wear it because I forget to choose
